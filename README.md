# An experimental router for dotnet Avalonia code-first applications

This router is kind of inspired by the angular/vue/navigo router. For sure it still needs work but for the moment it is kind of alive.

There are very rough edges and the design is... well it is not designed at all. It is just a bunch of code that works for the moment.

(that last sentence is courtesy of GH Copilot, it has some kind of sense of humor lol)
While this is being currently tested with Avalonia, it ideally will be extensible enough to be used elsewhere.
